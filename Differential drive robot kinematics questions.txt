Using Matlab perform simulation of the differential drive platform. The
vehicle parameters are as follows: sampling period Ts = 0.033 s, time of
simulation 10 s, wheel radius r = 0.04 m, distance between the wheels L =
0.08 m.

Tasks:

1. Calculate analytically and by means of simulation the shape of the path
done by the robot if the initial state is q(0) = [x, y, ϕ]T = [0,−0.5, 0]T
and robot inputs in three cases are the following:
• v(t) = 0.5 m/s, ω(t) = 0 rad/s;
• v(t) = 1 m/s, ω(t) = 2 rad/s;
• the wheels angular velocities are ωL(t) = 24 rad/s, ωR(t) =
16 rad/s.
What are the wheels’ angular speeds? Is the calculated and simulated path
the same. Why or why not?


2. Perform localization of the vehicle at constant input speeds
(v(t) = 0.5 m/s, ω(t) = 1 rad/s) using odometry. Compare the estimated
path with the simulated path of the true robot. Compare the
obtained results also in the ideal situation without noise and modeling
error.


3. Perform the localization from question 2 also with initial state error
(suppose the true initial state is unknown; therefore choose the initial
state in localization to be different from the one in simulation).


4. Imagine a path composed of two or three straight line segments where
the initial point coincides with the initial robot pose. Calculate the
required sequence of inputs to drive the robot on that path (time of
simulation is 10 s).


5. Choose some trajectory defined as parametric functions of time (x(t) =
f (t) and y(t) = g(t)), where f and g are smooth functions. Calculate
required inputs to follow this path. What happens if the robot initially is
not on the trajectory?


6. Simulate the parallel parking maneuver described in Example 2.2.
Choose proper ε and constant velocities v and ω.


7. For a given initial state q(0) = [0,−0.5, 0]T calculate the kinematic
matrix S and constraint matrix A.
